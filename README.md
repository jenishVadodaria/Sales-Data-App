# Sales Tool - Company Data

# Project Outline: User Portal, Admin Portal, and Backend

This project will consist of three main parts:

- A User Portal built using React
- An Admin Portal also built using Refine-React
- Backend Services built using NestJS

The portals will be responsible for displaying data to the users and admin respectively, while the backend will manage the business logic and data storage.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js, npm/yarn, and NestJS CLI installed on your machine.

You also need a basic understanding of TypeScript, React, and NestJS.

## Part 1: User Portal (React)

### Step 1: Project Setup

To create a new React app, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx create-react-app user-portal
cd user-portal
```

### Step 2: Building Components

Outline the structure of your User Portal. For example, you could have components such as:

- Home
- Login
- Profile
- Dashboard

For each of these, create a new file in the `src/components/` directory and use the basic React component structure.

---

## Part 2: Admin Portal (React)

Repeat the process outlined above, adjusting as necessary for your Admin Portal:

```sh
npx create-react-app admin-portal
cd admin-portal
```

Consider components like:

- Home
- Login
- Admin Dashboard
- User Management
- Content Management

---

## Part 3: Backend (NestJS)

### Step 1: Project Setup

Install NestJS CLI globally and create a new project:

```sh
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new backend
```

### Step 2: Building Modules

In NestJS, you'll want to create modules for each main feature of your application. For instance, you could create the following modules:

- User Management
- Authentication
- Content Management

For each of these, run the following command in the `backend/` directory:

```sh
nest generate module <module-name>
```

---

## Running the Application

Once you've developed your applications, you can start each one using npm/yarn.

For the React applications (User and Admin portals):

```sh
npm start
```

For the NestJS backend:

```sh
npm run start
```

Remember to run your applications in separate terminals.

---

## Conclusion

That's the basic outline for setting up a User Portal, an Admin Portal in React, and a backend in NestJS. You'll need to expand upon this based on your specific project requirements and functionalities. Good luck!
